# file-server
## *A simple command line file server written in javascript for node.js*
### What is it?

file-server is a simple file server designed for the terminal. This is an example project for the lighthouse labs web developer bootcamp. 

This project should help outline my understanding and practical usage of npm libraries including node's built in libraries ```fs```, ```net```, ```readline``` and third party libraries including ```chalk```. This project is version controlled with GIT (duh) and hosted on npm.

This project does not incorporate TDD techniques.
